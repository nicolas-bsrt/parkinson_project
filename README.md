# EEG and spike trains analysis in GPe of Parkinsonian rats models

With this notebook, we aim at deciphering the relationship between brain waves and spike trains in neurons of the GPe, where we hypothesize to find two populations of neurons having different relationship. 

This project was made within the "code and data analysis" course of the Neuroscience master degree of Bordeaux University.
